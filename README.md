In this project, we will use the Tokyo Olympic 2021 Datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo)

And then extract and Ingest the data into Azure Data Factory using **HTTP** protocol and Sink it into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2.

Finally, we use Azure Databricks to do some simple transformations and load the transformed data back into Azure Data Lake again.
